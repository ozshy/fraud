Derive and R files for a paper titled: "Whistleblowers and Financial Fraud"

by Oz Shy

*** How Table 1 was constructed (Appendix A in the paper) ***

The spreadsheet sec_awards_2025_mm_dd.xlsx provides the raw data that I collected from 133 SEC press releases during 2012-2024. It also contains links to each of the 133 press releases. 

The R-code sec_awards_2025_mm_dd.R inputes the spreadsheet and generates Table 1 in LaTeX format.
