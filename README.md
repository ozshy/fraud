Derive and R files for a paper titled: "Whistleblowers and Financial Fraud"

by Oz Shy

*** How Table 1 was constructed (Appendix A in the paper) ***

The spreadsheet sec_awards_2025_mm_dd.xlsx provides the raw data that I collected from 133 SEC press releases during 2012-2024. It also contains links to each of the 133 press releases. 

The R-code sec_awards_2025_mm_dd.R inputes the spreadsheet and generates Table 1 in LaTeX format. 

*** Other files in the repository (not related to Table 1) ***

All algebraic derivations for the above article (not related to data) can be found on "fraud_2025_mm_dd.dfw.pdf" (which the reader can download). The reader can then scroll down to the desired derivation using the same section, subsection, and equation numbers correspoding to the paper itself.

The above PDF file was constructed using a symbolic algebra software called "Derive for Windows." The file "fraud_2025_mm_dd.dfw" requires this sofware (which most people don't have). Therefore, it is sufficient  to download only the PDF.

The R-code fraud_2025_mm_dd.R just plots few similations for verification purposes only.
